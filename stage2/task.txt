Stage 2/5: Virtual card deck

Description
In this stage, we will create a virtual card deck.

Provide the following operations to the card deck:

Get the top cards from the deck and print them. Remove these cards from the deck;
Shuffle the deck;
Reset the deck (deal a new deck of 52 cards).
In this stage, we will also create a simple menu to test our virtual card deck.

Objectives
Print the message: Choose an action (reset, shuffle, get, exit):. Users can choose one of the available options reset, shuffle, get, exit, and press enter. In case users enter anything else, print the message Wrong action. and ask users once again (Example 4).

If reset:

Reset the deck to the original 52 cards;
Print the message Card deck is reset.;
Prompt for new action.
If shuffle:

Change the order of the remaining cards in the deck;
Print the message Card deck is shuffled.;
Prompt for new action.
If get:

Ask for the number of cards to be taken from the top of the deck with the prompt Number of cards:
Users should input a number between 1 and 52. Otherwise, for any number outside this range or for any non-number input, print Invalid number of cards. (Example 2);
These cards are to be removed from the top of the deck and printed divided by one space (6♦ 3♦ 8♦ 4♠ 9♦). If the number of cards is larger than the number of the remaining cards in the deck, print The remaining cards are insufficient to meet the request. (Example 3);
Prompt for new action.
If exit:

Print Bye;
Terminate the program.
